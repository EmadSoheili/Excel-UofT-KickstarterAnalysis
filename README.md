# Kickstarting with Excel Challenge 

***University of Toronto - Data Analytics Boot Camp - Module 1 - Kickstarting with Excel***

## Overview of Project

The project is about a fundraising campaign for a theater play. The campaign owner wants to reach a goal of $10000.  
On the basis of fundraising campaigns, I have tried to find trends and other insights in order to give the project owner some advices about her campaign.  

---

### Purpose

The Purpose of this project is to determine the best possible launch time, and extract some insights about the relation between the success odds and campaignâ€™s goal amount. This will provide the campaign owner with some valuable insights to plan accordingly.

### Analysis and Challenges

The analysis has been carried out in Microsoft Excel. The methodology used was the principles of descriptive analytics. No advanced analysis is included.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The below illustrated chart will yield some insights:  
1.  Most successful campaigns were launched in May.  
2. The number of successful campaigns will drop as we go forward through the time.  
3. The number of failed campaigns is relatively constant with an acceptable noise.  
4. The number of cancelled campaigns is constant and negligible during the year.  
5. It seems the best seasons for launching a fundraising campaign are the end of Spring and the whole Summer.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Findings on Outcome based on Goals:  
1. As the campaign goals increase, the odds of having a successful campaign will decrease.  
2. There is an abnormal behavior in chart between levels 8 and 10. Most probably the reason behind this is the few numbers of observations in this part of the chart. Since the number of observations is very low, the illustrated behavior might not be reliable.  
3. The cancelled campaigns portion is absolute zero.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

1. There might be numerous factors, such as culture, religion, etc. involved in the faith of a fundraising campaign. Relying on dates and goals cannot provide us with the whole picture.  
2. There were no exact question about the insights needed. The problem is too broad and anyone can have different perspectives and understating of the situation.

## Results

- **What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**  
1. Launching the campaign in May is highly recommended.
2. The weather temperature might have a direct impact on the result of a fundraising campaign as late Spring and Summer are the best seasons for launching one.

---

- **What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**  
1. Apparent trend is that the probability of having a successful fundraising campaign will decrease dramatically with goal upsurge.  
2. Having a goal between $15000 and $20000 will give us a 50-50 chance to have a successful campaign, just like flipping a coin. It seems a bit risky.

---

- **What are some limitations of this dataset?**  
1. We do not know the source of this dataset and whether it can be trusted or not.  
2.  There were no metadata, so some parts of the dataset are not clear with the risk of misinterpretation.


---

- **What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**  
1. Duration of the campaigns could be involved in our analysis, in order to determine whether launching a campaign for a prolonged period of time will be beneficial or not.  
2. Using graphs about other categories and subcategories, especially the ones related to art, probably fruitful for our analysis.
